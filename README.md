# Rock Paper Scissor Game
## Introduction
The rps is based on the real children rock paper game and follows the exact rules.
This project had been part of  <a href="http://theodinproject.com">**The Odin Project**</a>

## Todo
Though the is almost done but having this todo would help me in adding functions or changes and understanding or visualising were the going is headed.

* Now, to update the buttons for the weapons to an image or icon: <span style="color:red">Done </span>.
* To End the game after 5wins from the computer or the player: <span style="color:blue">Done </span>.
* At the endgame remove all the elements on screen and display only the option to play again or quit: <span style="color:red">pending </span>.
* After end the user can replay the game again another five rounds: <span style="color:red">pending </span>.
* At a point the user can change the max number of wins to endgame: <span style="color:red">pending </span>.

## Gained
This project was the most challenging sofar.
